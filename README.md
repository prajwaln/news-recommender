###### Prajwal Rao | prajwal.rao@outlook.com.au | Project 1 (Tech Stream) | MSA 2020

## Description
In this fast-changing and unprecendented times, there is something new happening almost everyday and it can sometimes be difficult to keep track of the news. To solve this problem, this module is designed to recommend news articles based on a user's reading history and also factor in various preferences including topics, source etc. - for a more personalised experience.

This concept has been implemented on a widely available news dataset on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-category-dataset) by [author](https://rishabhmisra.github.io/publications/). This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-category-dataset) contains around 200k news headlines from the year 2012 to 2018 obtained from HuffPost. 

## Environment Setup and Dependencies

The entire project has written in Python Jupyter Notebook in [Azure ML studio](https://ml.azure.com/#) environment and required packages and dependencies are available in that. Any additional sownloads or installations are performed in the notebook.

Alternatively, a [requirements.txt](../blob/master/requirements.txt) file has been provided which can be used to setup a new environment.

Compute and Storage requirements:
- RAM: 4 GB
- Storage: 200 MB

## Step-by-step instructions
